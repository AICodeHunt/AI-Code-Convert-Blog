## What is AI Code Explanation?

Code explanation using AI involves using machine learning algorithms and natural language processing techniques to generate human-readable explanations of code. 
This can help make code more accessible to non-experts, 
such as business stakeholders or users, and can help developers better understand complex codebases.

### How does code explanation using AI work?

Code explanation using AI typically involves analyzing code and generating natural language explanations based on features such as code structure, variable names, and comments. 
Machine learning algorithms can be trained on large datasets of code and associated explanations to learn patterns and generate new explanations for unseen code. 
Natural language processing techniques can also be used to ensure that the generated explanations are grammatically correct and semantically meaningful.
