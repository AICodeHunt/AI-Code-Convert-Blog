## What is code review ?

Code review is the process of evaluating and improving code by having other developers review it for quality, readability, and correctness. 
It is important because it helps to identify and address potential issues early on, leading to better overall code quality.

### How does AI learn to perform code review?

AI learns to perform code review through machine learning algorithms that are trained on large datasets of code samples. 
These algorithms can then identify patterns and potential issues within code and provide feedback and recommendations for improvement.
