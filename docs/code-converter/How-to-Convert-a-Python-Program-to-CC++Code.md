## How to Convert a Python Program to C/C++ Code

Python is a highly extensible, unified, and object-oriented programming language. 
It can be used in a variety of well-known industries, including data science, application development, 
and machine learning. Python’s simplicity and usability are its key benefits. 
It has many functionalities like dynamic typing and flexible modules which save developer’s time.

This tutorial will tell you about different ways in which you can convert Python programs to C/C++ language.

### Convert Python Programs to C/C++ Code

You can convert a Python program to C/C++ code in the following ways:

- Manually
- Via Online Converter/Compiler
- Via System Compiler

### Method 1: Convert Python Programs to C/C++ Code With AICodeConvert

To manually convert Python code to C++, the following aspects should be kept in mind:

- You must be familiar with the basic syntax of Python, C++, and C language.
- Identify the equivalent constructors, libraries of Python with respect to C/C++ language. For example, the Python language list can be translated into C++ vectors and Python for loop can be translated into C/C++ for loop.
- Then convert your code and apply testing on it.
- After the testing phase, move to debug to remove your bugs and make sure your code works properly.

### Method 2: Convert Python Programs to C/C++ Code Via an [AICodeConvert](https://aicodeconvert.com)

If you find it difficult to manually change the Python program to C/C++, 
you can use another approach which is by using different online converters or compilers. 
Among these online converters, you can use the [AICodeConvert](https://aicodeconvert.com) compiler which is simple to use and quickly provide you with the converted code in seconds.

### Method 3: Convert Python Programs to C/C++ Code Via System Compiler

You can also install a compiler on your system that will let you convert a Python program to C/C++. 
The following are some compilers you can install on your system.

#### 1: Cython
Cython compiler gives us a C extension into Python. The Python language is a superset of the Cython language. 
Cython can convert Python code into C/C++ as it has an extension of the C language. 
But it also requires some manual change in code so it is not good for large projects.

#### 2: Transcrypt
Python code can be converted to C++ using the Python-to-JavaScript converter name Transcrypt. The open-source application can transform Python code to C++ with a straightforward command line interface.

You need to install it on your local system first before the conversion of Python code into C code.

#### 3: Nukita
Nukita is another effective compiler that can convert a Python program into C/C++ within a few seconds in a much better way compared to Cython and Transcrypt. It can handle a wide range and Python code and can perform the conversion with ease.

**Note**: You can convert Python programs to C/C++ with these methods. However, the conversion through online or system compilers may not be 100% accurate. You may still require manual setup after the code conversion in some cases.

### Conclusion
You can convert a Python program to C/C++ manually if you have a proper understanding of all these languages. 
This could be complex but an excellent strategy to use. 
However, the users can use an online compiler or install a compiler on the system to perform Python program conversion from C/C++. 
However, the conversion through the compiler won’t be 100% accurate, in some cases the users have to do some manual editing to make it run on the C/C++ compiler.
